# Object Detection Using YOLO

üöÄ Excited to share my latest project on Object Detection using the YOLO model! üñºÔ∏èüîç

## Tools Used:
- YOLO (You Only Look Once) model
- OpenCV
- Python

## Key Features:
- **Real-time Detection:** Processes video frames in real-time, identifying objects swiftly and accurately.
- **High Accuracy:** Utilizes the advanced YOLO model for precise object detection.
- **Customizable:** Easily adaptable for various applications and specific detection needs.

## Highlights:
- **Speed and Efficiency:** Achieved impressive detection speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Seamless Integration:** Integrated the detection system seamlessly with other applications, enhancing its usability.
- **Custom Detection:** Developed custom detection capabilities for specific project requirements.

## Installation and Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-yolo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd object-detection-yolo
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the detection script:
   ```bash
   python detect.py
   ```

## Future Work:
